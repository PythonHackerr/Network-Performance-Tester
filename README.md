A tool disigned to test network performance (bandwidth) using the UDP protocol. The tool consists of a server and a client. The client call parameter will specify the size of the data packet and the server address and port. At the end of the test, statistics on upload and download speeds as well as packet loss and delay will be displayed. Tests should also be carried out in real conditions of wide area networks in the form of a connection to a server located, e.g. on a virtual machine in a cloud service.
